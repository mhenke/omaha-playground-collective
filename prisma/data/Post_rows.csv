60,Seymour Smith All Play Playground Time to,"Seymour Smith All Play Playground 

Time to feature one of my favorite parks in Omaha—Seymour Smith Playground (+ Splash Pad!) Seymour Smith is one of Omaha’s only barrier-free playgrounds ensuring access to all kids who come to play. It is amazing how often I meet mamas out and about that have not heard of this park. 

As a playground that is accessible to all, I love that the structure has ramps for kids to run, walk or roll (there is enough room for two wheelchairs!) Parents can assist their younger kiddos around the structure and there is still always room for everyone to buzz around and play. There are plenty of slides, ladders, and other features to keep everyone busy, which means that you can spend a long time at this one. With the splash pad so close by, your kids can go back and forth. I like this particular splash pad, it’s smaller than most others, but my daughter loves it and can easily spend 45 minutes here! 

I’m sure the no sand crew already saw from the photos—there is NO SAND! There is a soft, rubberized surface that does get warm as the sun shines on it all day. There are porta potties always available, as well as bathrooms that are open at certain times throughout the week as the baseball diamonds are open for games. There is plenty of parking as well! 

Ok, I gotta know—are you a Seymour fan, or have you never heard of it? When are you going to hit it up?! ",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-08-29 19:25:09,2023-08-29 19:25:09,3180264634149933232
67,"Elmwood Park Playground An old classic park,","Elmwood Park Playground 

An old classic park, we absolutely love coming here, affectionately named “Sandy Park” by my daughter—and yes, this one is sandy! 

Elmwood has multiple climbing structures with one geared towards older kids, and another for smaller toddlers (see slide 2!). Tons of natural shade from trees allow this park to be shaded from sun up to sundown, and tons of benches for the mamas who have graduated to “watch from a bench status.”

The most unique feature of this playground actually isn’t the equipment, but the dozens of toys scattered throughout. Before you stick your nose up like I did at first—these toys are BELOVED by the kids that visit this playground, even the broken ones. I used to think, “why on earth are the broken ones still here?” But the imagination I see happen when kids turn a broken truck wheel into a pirate’s buried treasure is unmatched. I’ve seen kids play for over an hour at this playground before even climbing on the equipment! 

Ok, down to the nitty gritty: while, yes, there are porta-potties, I would NOT recommend their use, and honestly just say “no bathrooms!” Unfortunately no water fountains, either—BYOW! (Bring your own water!) The area has a nice Little Rock wall around half of it, but not a fence. I’d you’ve got a runner, there is so much space around far from any busy roads or parking lots that generally you’d be able to catch them! Ha! 

Bonus? Closest drive through coffee joint is a locally owned favorite— @dundeedoubleshot

41,Metcalfe Park The East O Mamas have,"Metcalfe Park 

The East O Mamas have been recommending this little neighborhood gem, and here we are! So many of you consider this one your “go to” park, and I can see why! 

It’s got the enough of the classics to keep all littles busy—slides, swings and some climbing challenges. There are two structures, with one being definitely for our smaller playground pros as it has the smallest slide I’ve ever seen at a public park. We are talking red and blue Little Tykes Slide level small. It was so cute! There is plenty of natural shade and so many benches. Tucked in an old neighborhood means lots of BIG trees. No bathrooms and street parking put this playground in the “no frills” category. I’m sure y’all also noticed it has the s-word (s-a-n-d), but plenty of sidewalk and rubberized surface for us mamas with strollers to walk around. 

The biggest pro tip I’ve got for Metcalfe? Hit up @scbcomaha or @hayjaycoffee with some pals and then come over to Metcalfe to burn off some energy while y’all can possibly relax. Oh wait, we are moms at a playground we don’t know what it’s like to relax.",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-09-15 02:35:00,2023-09-15 02:35:00,3192077396160661654

42,Benson Park Playground We have finally made,"Benson Park Playground 

We have finally made the trek over to Benson to feature the Benson Park Playground! It was such a beautiful day to be out at a playground and our visit to Benson didn’t disappoint. We love this playground as it’s a big structure with a wide variety of things to keep your little ones busy! Benson Playground is another All Play Playground similar to Seymour Smith, so there is a rubberized play surface, ramps and swings that accommodate all kiddos. 

There are five slides, different climbing challenges and so much room to just run—which brings me to mention that it isn’t fenced or contained and is relatively close to Military Avenue nearby, so if you’ve got a little one with wheels, be conscious of this! With so much to do you’ll see kids of all ages here enjoying playtime, and that always makes my “playground lady” heart all warm and fuzzy. 

The park is right by the Benson Park Lagoon as well as the splash pad that is closed for the season—to be featured next year! There looked to be a portapotty some distance away—but it’s safe to say no bathrooms are convenient. There are benches, picnic tables and lots of shade to enjoy as your littles play. 

Have you been here before? What do you like about Benson Playground?",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-10-11 22:08:36,2023-10-11 22:08:36,3211512257410108727
44,Lake Manawa Dream Land Playground I can’t,"Lake Manawa Dream Land Playground 

I can’t think of a better name for this park, it was truly a dream come true! I can’t even think of where to start as it was all so much fun. @iowaparksrec we are so into this one! 

This almost entirely enclosed (!!) playground is ADA accessible, and this benefits everyone, because the ramps and surfaces made for hours of play this morning. The wooden structure has been treated so no fear of splinters. As you see in the photos, there is literally something for everyone here—so many little “houses” and stores for your imaginative kiddos, as well as many different monkey bars, balance beams and spinners for your littles who need to burn energy. Everywhere you look there is something else to play with—a section that looks like a boat, complete with steering wheel, a small elephant slide, and swings! 

There is also an enclosed section that is for your littles, and it’s the only area of the park with a small sandbox, so those of you who avoid sand, it’s easy to do here. There are signs up with suggestions for what ages kids can enjoy which sections, but I would say all ages will have fun at this entire park! The ramps around the big structure make it easy to follow your little ones that might not understand their limits yet, and you never feel like you’re in the way of everyone else trying to get their playground on. 

There is either rubberized surface, mulch or rubberized mulch (??). There is plenty of parking as well as bathrooms. So many area for picnics and places to bring a lunch or snacks so that if you’re making a longer drive you can make your time worth it!

Today we visited this little gem in Ralston! This playground is a biggie, and is perfect for kids who are pretty solid climbers. The equipment is a little dated, but that makes for some fun discoveries for your little ones! We had fun on a large climbing structure which definitely flexed our problem solving skills. With a huge twisty slide, so many bridges and multiple towers, your littles will be busy for a while! One thing I noticed is that so many of the monkey bars and hanging features are very tall! They are high in the air, and we avoided those so that didn’t have a long way to fall if we couldn’t make it across. 

There are swings, tons of benches, and both shade structures and natural shade from large trees! There is a great little trail that goes around the park that you could walk around and keep your eyes on your kiddos if you’re able to let them play independently. 

It’s such a nice little park, and I was surprised that it was empty for the entire time we were there! So tell me—have you been to this one?",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-09-06 20:17:38,2023-09-06 20:17:38,3186089261061279459
45,Wildewood Park We headed over to Ralston,"Wildewood Park 

We headed over to Ralston yesterday to visit Wildewood Park Playground! This was suggested by one of y’all (yes please send me more!) and what a fabulous suggestion! 

This structure, while small compared to some, packs a punch with slides and climbing structures. The most unique being the fish ladder! My playground tester loved that you climbed up the back of the fish (which obviously looks like its backbone!) and hopped right into a slide. This playground was a blast, we had fun on the swings and rope climbers. 

This park is tucked into some major trees, and as a mama, it felt so peaceful. It was quiet, away from main roads and small enough that I could sit and relax as the kids played. There were restrooms and even a volleyball court to play on. This would most likely be 5/5 stars for most, but it does have sand! 

Have you been to Wildewood? And how fun is that fish?! ",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-09-12 13:39:43,2023-09-12 13:39:43,3190237634202508779
43,Standing Bear Lake Play Area If you,"Standing Bear Lake Play Area

If you have littles who are full of imagination or just like to climb on everything—Standing Bear is the place for y’all! This playground is unique in that it mostly encourages kids to climb, balance and use their creativity while they have fun here. 

The fun outdoors and Native theme just adds to the magic as kids run jump and clim around the canoe, teepees and rocks and caves. In between the rubberized surface and sand are ropes to climb and balance, as well as animals—a baby bear, a horse and a few frogs! While we were there I saw kids from age 2-12 playing games and exploring. I’ve seen many versions of “The Floor is Lava” during our adventures, and this playground is ALMOST perfect for it.

There are no bathrooms nearby to the play area, and not much shade for parents to chill under as your kids explore. This is a bummer because this is a great playground to give your littlest ones some freedom as there isn’t much that is that tall where they could get into trouble! There are also two baby swings nearby. 

Hot Tip: Enter this play area through Entrance 4 off of 132nd street—drive until you see it! Bring your stroller and walking shoes and get a workout in while you’re here!

What a fun playground with some great views of Zorinsky Lake! This playground has three sections—a smaller structure, a rope course and a larger structure with swings! 

We had fun running between the three sections, and I think you’ll find something for kids of all ages here. With tons of natural shade over the benches as well as a shaded structure with picnic tables, you can definitely find some relief of these hot final summer days! 

There are bathrooms nearby, and also… you’re at Zorinsky! There is a high trail to walk, run or even bike if y’all need to get some exercise in addition to some playing! 

Sorry sand-haters: I featured ANOTHER sand park! I promise no sand at my next venture! 

Pro-tip: plug in Zorinsky Soccer Fields to get the correct playground.

This small structure was on a big ol’ list of playgrounds in Omaha. Due to where we were during this morning, proximity to our location brought us here. 

Towl Park is tucked away near 90th and Center—with baseball diamonds, a basketball hoop and right near the Keystone Trail this has the makings of a great little spot. What I will say is that this playground is perfect for mamas who like to get their steps in + their miles logged! Pack up the scooters, bikes and strollers and get out on the Keystone. A couple of minutes walk from the parking lot, and you get to the playground. Perfect to let them get their wiggles out, then I would think they’d be ready to move on. The equipment is a little dated and just sort of a small structure.

No frills here—a couple of benches, shade from the trees and no bathrooms. Ultimately. I’ll be back with a friend or two along with our strollers and kiddos to get our steps in, and we will make a quick pit stop at the structure to burn some energy off.

Ok, Papillion mamas—I see you! How have I not been here before?! This park is huge, complete with baseball diamonds, tennis courts, a cute pond, walking trails and of course, playgrounds! 

There are two playgrounds at Halleck park, and we loved this “big kid” one! Three stories tall and lots of variety for kids to climb, slide and use their imaginations. (It’s a perfect Paw Patrol lookout tower!) This particular structure is great for your bigger kiddos, we stayed here so long that I wasn’t able to visit the other structure (which looks better for your littles!) 

While we were there, we ran into the moms and instructors from @fit4mom.omahasouth and if you’re a mama of littles and want to workout with other moms and their kids, this is a great group for you! Word on the street is that they do lots of playing afterwards

A double whammy well worth your time! Out West in Elkhorn, The Grove delivers for almost everyone in your group. The photos might not make it look it, but dang it was busy today! Even with how busy it is, there is enough room for everyone to spread out and play!

Up first, the playground itself is great for most kids above toddler-hood. Those sure on their feet and moderate to excellent climbers will love all of the different options with this equipment. The surface of the playground is all rubberized play surface, but right nearby is a small sandpit (where of course most of the shade is!). Benches are around the park, but each one is unshaded. (A pro-tip would be to bring your own chairs or a blanket and set up in the shade under nearby the structure!) there’s a small shaded pavilion with two picnic tables by the playground and a larger one near the splash pad with about 8 tables!

The splash pad is a total hoot! There are fountains and water features for kids of all ages—from a small little frog waterfall to the huge bucket that dumps A LOT of water every 3-5 minutes! Surface is treated to be mostly non-slip as well as cool(ish) to the touch. We love bringing cups and water toys to fill up and dump out ourselves. 

There are also so many other features here! 
- Ample parking, including handicap spots
-New bathrooms that are well looked after 
- 4 Pickleball Courts as well as 1 Tennis Court

So, I had no intention of posting about our visit here today, however, my playground tester (aka— my 3.5 year old daughter) can sniff a playground out better than anyone! After the amazing morning we had here today, I wanted to share how much fun we really did have while at the @simmonswildlifesafari Park! 

Even after becoming a parent, I didn’t realize how much is offered at the Wildlife Safari Park in Ashland. I always thought you went, drove in a loop and then headed on home. I was gladly wrong about most of that—while yes, driving in a loop of the park is a main part of the visit, there are opportunities to get out, hike and look at the animals from lookout towers. There is an area right in the middle of the park that houses the education center, bathrooms, a small concession stand and picnic tables where you can bring your own picnic lunch! Right near there is the Eagle Aviary and you can see the bald eagles! From there, head on the mile loop to to see the bears, wolves and even some owls. 

And yes, at the beginning (or end!) of your journey you can park and have your littles get their wiggles out at the little playground. With a wood chip surface, there are two small slides, monkey bars and a few other features—just enough to burn some energy off before hopping in the car to visit some bison  There is also a small nature playground also in the park where if you’ve got some wiggles, your kids can check that out, too! (Didn’t snap a photo of this one!!!) 

Right now there is the Jurassic Adventure with dinosaurs scattered through the park, where it sometimes feels like you’re in Jurassic Park (especially if you’re driving a jeep!) 

All in all, you can easily spend a whole morning or even a whole day exploring!

One of our favorites to come for a little bit or sometimes we stay for over an hour—like this evening! Stinson Park is a great location with a structure best suited for your littles, but I’ve seen some big kids get down on this playground! 

Most of the slides and ladders are great for your newest daredevils (literally, what is it about being 2 years old makes one feel invincible???) as well as those who are more hesitant climbers. With low, achievable ladders, shorter slides and a small rock wall everyone will find something to like here. If you’re bringing littles, your best bet is to visit in those AM hours when most bigs are in school, as the after school and dinner hours get busy! There is a big loop around a large green space for some walking or you’ll catch some big kids zooming around on bikes, scooters or skateboards. There’s a sizable shaded spot with a few benches if y’all can sit with your park pal and watch your kiddos—and for that most of us are jealous of you. 

The best part about this park is all of the businesses nearby—including @roast_coffeehouse  There are also spots for lunch — @innerrailfoodhall and @jones_bros_cupcakes ! On Sundays during the summer catch the @omahafarmersmarket where you can grab some fresh local produce and let your little get some wiggles out.

What better way to spend an entire summer morning than at the Chalco Hills playground? This playground has three different climbing structures—with one of them dedicated to our smaller climbers. A little walk around the outside of the playground has three little pit stops for kids to use their imaginations—one as a gas station and two storefronts! 
I consistently see kids of all ages playing here, so no matter what age you’ve got, they will find something to do here! 

A music area with xylophones, bongos, and even a glockenspiel (!!) every kid that comes to this park can find something to float their boat! 

Other features:
-Shaded pavilion with picnic tables
-Nature “playground” nearby
-Gaga Ball Pit
- A sandpit across the way with four different spinners inside (I was able to keep my daughter away from the sand for her first few visits! So if you aren’t big on sand, it’s easy to corral your kiddo away!)

Today we hit up this neighborhood park in Millard! This park is a climber’s DREAM!  With multiple structures to climb—faux stone, logs and rope ladders—this is a great place for your busiest bodies. The giant slide was a fun feature we went down over and over, as well as the rope bridge to climb across. 

This park is most ideal for a 5 and up crowd who are on the more experienced climbing side. My own 3.5 year old is a pretty confident climber and was not loving how high or unsteady the ropes were. The challenges and room for imagination definitely are more suited for those older kids. For those with only toddlers, I’d skip this one and keep it in your back pocket until they’re older! 

Surface is supposed to be half sand and half rubberized surface, the sand has definitely taken over, and I’d say this is mostly sand. This is truly a neighborhood park—no parking lot and no bathrooms! There is an awesome walking trail that pops around the playground and into the neighborhood—if I wasn’t in a time crunch I would have walked it a little to see how far it goes! (Any Millard moms for some insight?!) 

Overall we had tons of fun here, and it’s a great playground to round up some buddies and have some adventures.

Sooooo, do you like it or do you love it? Do you have a park that the moms and dads of Omaha just need to know about? Comment below, and I’ll add it to our Adventure list ",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-08-08 07:38:18,2023-08-08 07:38:18,3164688576159565839

We LOVED this playground! This park is catered to kids of all ages. There is a wide range of climbing challenges including a rock wall, log climbers and various ladders!

A shaded area with four picnic tables, a soft rubber play surface, and a small walking path going around the park—for those who like to get their steps in while watching their littles!

Final thoughts: without any bathrooms, it’s hard to call this an all day stay, but you can definitely keep your littles busy for a few hours 

So tell me— have you been? Are you going to check it out? ",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-08-07 19:48:44,2023-08-07 19:48:44,3164331441768662895
40," Lewis and Clark Landing Park at"," Lewis and Clark Landing Park at the Riverfront 

This sunny Saturday brought us downtown to the new Lewis and Clark Riverfront Park, and as soon as we turned the corner my playground tester was shouting “there it is!!” And of course she did—this park is so visually impressive and inviting that even I started smiling as we pulled into the parking lot. It’s mostly fenced in—yay—with one opening on the side near the new Kiewit Luminarium- @kiewitluminarium 

My daughter is almost 4, and as far as this park goes I would say that she is on the younger end of the range for the kids that can navigate this park independently. While all ages should go to all parks, unless you’ve got an older kiddo be ready to follow your little around as they explore. The structures are amazing in the sense that kids have got to use their critical thinking skills as they tackle hills, steps, logs and rock walls. 

The most obvious structures, the striking huge rockets are definitely BIG—even the “small” ones. There are nets inside to climb up as you navigate up to go down metal slides. (I’m ready for your help to comment with how they are during the summer.) The slides are big and fast, and I know they go fast. Set your kids up for success before they go up and let them know what it will be like. 

There is room for a water feature for water play—which is not a splash pad by any means. It’s closed for the season, but looks like some fun exploration and encourages experimentation, cause and effect and problem solving.

There is also a sand pit, benches, giant swings, and a Zipline! There are fairly clean bathrooms located inside right by a few picnic tables. We could have stayed here all day long, and maybe later on we will! 

Have you been here? Do you love the reimagined area downtown?",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-11-04 22:04:27,2023-11-04 22:04:27,3228904787999100327
58,Swanson Park Playground Today we buzzed over,"Swanson Park Playground

Today we buzzed over to Bellevue to check out Swanson Park Playground! What a fun little spot that is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Cornhusker. The park itself isn’t fenced, but is far enough away from major roads if you’ve got someone who roams around. 

We liked all of the climbing challenges, and some of these ladders and climbing structures go fairly high—so unless you’ve got a confident climber expect to be doing lots of spotting. It has a mulch surface, but I also noticed that some of the spots underneath the most popular spots (spinner, swings, etc) has been worn down actually making it hard for kids to independently climb onto these! With some TLC, it would be a great park to sit on the bench and enjoy this beautiful weather we are expected to have for this week!  There are so many picnic tables and lots of shade to have a fun play date or lunch picnic here!

We all know that as Nebraskans our warm weather doesn’t last forever, and there are always places we wish we had visited before there are inches of snow outside our doors. I have so many places left to go, so I thought—why not try something to get us all out trying some new places? 

Here’s how the Playground Passport works: screenshot the story and/or post with the passport image. Then, from now until October 31 work through the list on your own or with some pals. Tag me as you go or just at the end of the challenge for a chance to win! Each person who finishes the challenge will be entered to win a play date at @chirpysplaycafe (drinks for parents included!) to save for those first few cold days when you know you gotta take playtime inside! I will contact the winner via DM! 

Let’s have fun this fall, and get out and about before we drag those parkas out of the closet. Comment below—where are you heading? Tag your pal so they can get started, too! 

**Yes.. I totally know that some parks can double or triple dip—the idea is to try to new parks and playgrounds!

Y’all. Today we went to Stonecroft Park in Bellevue and dang, this place blew our minds! 

This barrier-free playground is absolutely huge, and has so many fun features we have not seen elsewhere! This playground is a sensory seeker’s paradise with a roller slide, different textures on slides, things to drum on and so many different things to climb that I hardly could count! We had a blast running all around trying everything. 

A large parking lot, shaded area with tables, and…no sand! A rubberized play surface is what you’ll find at this one. There is a maintained portapotty—how do I know this you may ask—because we had to use even with a few reminders to go before we left the house. (Tell me this happens to y’all.) There is a small trail nearby that links up with the Daniell Trail if you need some miles as well! 

I fully admit I am late to the Stonecroft Party—what about y’all? Who is heading there this week?",clpzow697000310stkk4w574j,2023-09-03 02:37:01,2023-09-03 02:37:01,3183381106770001397

This one may seem like a no brainer for y’all, but even if one person learns about the amazingness that is the Adventure Trails Exhibit at the Henry Doorly Zoo. You could very easily make your entire zoo visit to the Adventure Trails (like we did!) or at least spend most of your morning there. 

With a 250 foot long stream with a waterfall, tons of opportunities to climb and explore, and an impressive 40-foot treehouse there is something for everyone. It’s very spread out, so if you’ve got multiple busy bees, I’d recommend bringing reinforcements to explore different areas. These structures are so well thought out so that your climbers can explore and gain confidence as they climb the web structure, beehive, or the treehouse. The treehouse has a huge, awesome slide that has a height requirement, and I would recommend someone exploring with those who are 3 and under up there! 

These bathrooms are also the best kept secret of the zoo, with two family bathrooms with kid-sized toilets and two areas where you can nurse your littlest ones. On weekend days, the snack bar has healthy, kid-friendly snacks—but as always you can pack snacks and drinks from home. 

- Current Hours are M-F 9-1pm, Weekends 9-5; Closes for the season on September 17 (they get ready for Ghouls and Glow!) 
- This is included in Zoo admission and Memberships!

48," Flanagan Lake Park Playground We finally"," Flanagan Lake Park Playground

We finally were able to spend lots of time outside now that the temperatures weren’t the same as the surface of the sun. We made our way out west to Lake Flanagan. I was tipped off about this beaut of a playground, and dang I wish I had known about this one before now! This structure is amazing with 5+ slides and countless ladders and places for kids to climb and even have room to run! Kids were playing all types of games—there was a big group playing tag with still lots of room for littles to climb and walk safely without bumping into each other. 

There was a fun rock wall + slide combo off to the side as well as an area for swings. There is green space all around, and while there isn’t a fence around it, it is below the parking lots, making it hard for a runner to put themselves in huge danger (unless you’ve got Usain Bolt on your hands!) There are bathrooms and plenty of shade, benches and tables. You can truly spend all day here, because after playground and lunch, head out for a ride, walk or run on the trail around the lake.

I couldn’t think of one negative about this park, until I realized that—yes, there is sand! Sand-haters, you might want to still give this one a chance, it is that good! 

Hot Tip: this entrance is off of Ida Street—make sure you type in “Flanagan Lake Playground” into your GPS!
