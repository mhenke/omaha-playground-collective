1,Blondo Ridges Park,"We LOVED this playground! This park is catered to kids of all ages. There is a wide range of climbing challenges including a rock wall, log climbers and various ladders!

A shaded area with four picnic tables, a soft rubber play surface, and a small walking path going around the park—for those who like to get their steps in while watching their littles!

Final thoughts: without any bathrooms, it’s hard to call this an all day stay, but you can definitely keep your littles busy for a few hours 

So tell me— have you been? Are you going to check it out? ",clpqzoh3s000cr0c44166u298,4,2023-11-18 17:11:00,2023-11-18 17:11:06
3,Elmwood Park Playground,"An old classic park, we absolutely love coming here, affectionately named “Sandy Park” by my daughter—and yes, this one is sandy!

Elmwood has multiple climbing structures with one geared towards older kids, and another for smaller toddlers (see slide 2!). Tons of natural shade from trees allow this park to be shaded from sun up to sundown, and tons of benches for the mamas who have graduated to “watch from a bench status.”

The most unique feature of this playground actually isn’t the equipment, but the dozens of toys scattered throughout. Before you stick your nose up like I did at first—these toys are BELOVED by the kids that visit this playground, even the broken ones. I used to think, “why on earth are the broken ones still here?” But the imagination I see happen when kids turn a broken truck wheel into a pirate’s buried treasure is unmatched. I’ve seen kids play for over an hour at this playground before even climbing on the equipment!

Ok, down to the nitty gritty: while, yes, there are porta-potties, I would NOT recommend their use, and honestly just say “no bathrooms!” Unfortunately no water fountains, either—BYOW! (Bring your own water!) The area has a nice Little Rock wall around half of it, but not a fence. I’d you’ve got a runner, there is so much space around far from any busy roads or parking lots that generally you’d be able to catch them! Ha!

Bonus? Closest drive through coffee joint is a locally owned favorite— @dundeedoubleshot

Tell me—have you been to Elmwood Park Playground?? Love it? Hate it? ",clpqzoh3s000cr0c44166u298,,2023-11-18 17:14:14,2023-11-18 17:14:09
4,Thank you,"Holy Cannoli—you Oma-Mamas really have outdone yourselves! The response to this new little corner of the internet shows that it is SO needed, and I can’t believe y’all are trusting me to bring you all the parks and playgrounds in the Omaha area!

I’ve gotten the nicest DMs with suggestions of places to go, words of encouragement and other ideas that I can’t wait to make happen!

Thanks again for your shares, your likes and your follow—I won’t let y’all down ",clpqzoh3s000cr0c44166u298,,2023-11-18 20:09:47,2023-11-18 20:09:52
2,We're new here,"Born from the idea that we shouldn’t have to rely on Google to find the perfect playground for our daily adventures, here is the Omaha Playground Collective!

Our goal is simple: it’s the idea that y’all will be able to find new parks and playgrounds + learn a little about them before packing up your whole family only to discover that a certain park has—gasp—sand! Or that there aren’t bathrooms at that playground. Maybe you need something for your big kids, or a park that will “last all morning”—we’ve all been there.

Discovering all of the amazing parks, playgrounds, splash pads and more in the Omaha area has always been my mission… so why keep it to myself?

Sooooo, do you like it or do you love it? Do you have a park that the moms and dads of Omaha just need to know about? Comment below, and I’ll add it to our Adventure list ",clpqzoh3s000cr0c44166u298,,2023-11-18 17:12:51,2023-11-18 17:12:55
