# CSCI4650-850: Intro To Cloud Computing

This final project is meant to let you practice what you have learned in this course through hands-on projects. I do not want to restrict your ideas. The rubrics are presented in the Final Project assignment, but I will list them here for your convenience:

## Project Requirements

- (10 points) Develop a dynamic web application using HTML, NodeJS, Javascript, or any web programming language you choose.
- (10 points) Your web application implementation should use the following:
  - Database (e.g., MySQL, RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)
  - One other cloud service we have learned during the semester (EC2, S3, CloudFormation, Lambda, etc.)
- (10 points) You may use the sample web applications demoed in the lectures as the starting point, or you can build your web application from scratch.

## Demo Video Requirements

- (5 points) A brief introduction on the group members (names, roles played in the group project, etc.).
- (5 points) An overview of all of the cloud services you have been using in the development process.
- (10 points) An overview of some highlights of your web application (something special about your product) that users should pay attention to in your later demo.
- (10 points) A demo of step-by-step instructions on how to deploy the web application (e.g., the link of your repository, how to install the environment dependencies, what cloud services need to be launched, what stack needs to be created, etc.) so the audience can follow your instructions and deploy your web application without any problems.
- (10 points) Finally, highlight the functionalities/features of your web application.
